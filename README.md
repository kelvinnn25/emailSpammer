The goal of this project was to send emails to politicians due to ongoing situation of overturning Roe V. Wade, taking an input from either google forms or through a front end application (preferably google forms to maintain security and anonymity).
Ended up being futile because poltician emails are not public information. 
Feel free to take this code if you have a resolution for the conflict, else contact me if you have any tips or reccomendations so I can help create the desired program!
All input is appreciated!!
